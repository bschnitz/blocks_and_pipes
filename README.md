# Blocks and Pipes for Python

This package implements two somehow similar, but still different concepts.

- **Blocks:** This is an effort to create something **similar to Ruby blocks** in
  python, d.i. a method to easily specify **multiple multiline callbacks** as
  **arguments for a function**.
- **Pipes:** There are some pipe implementations for python already. This one
  aims to be **flexible, easily extendable** and also allows for specifying
  **multiline callbacks** as pipe operations.

If you are not interested in *blah-blah-blah*, just skip the rationale and head
straight for the [Usage and Examples](#usage-and-examples) Section.
